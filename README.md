# Scrip
## Not quite a scrape, a little more than a crawl

Defaults to using socks proxy over port 9050, setting "clear" to true will ignore using a proxy.
Data gets saved as a json file in the current directory, with the domain "scrip'd" as the file name.

Usage:
``` 
./scrip -domain <domain> -clear <true/false>
```
